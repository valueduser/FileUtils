# FileUtils

### Todo:
- Option to hash only the first x bytes of large files
- Multithreading support
- Unit & integration tests
- Better menu
- Populate DB table with known hashes and locations of hashed files.
  - Table gets persisted so new hashes can be compared for global file deduplication
- Output file written to a user specified directory
